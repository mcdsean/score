# Defines how to run an analysis with Fortify for C/C++.
#
# 2017-02-09 jspielvogel@keywcorp.com added comments, TODOs, and refactored so the script is less tool-specific so that we can use this as a baseline for other tools' scripts
# 2013-06-07 jspielvogel@keywcorp.com modified to use argparse to parse the input; added more command line options; use the -h option for help on using this script 
# 2013-04-24 smcdonagh@keywcorp.com reviewed and added comments
# 2013-01-07 rhsteve@nsa.gov: updated scan command to analyze code with modifications to the properties file for deeper tracing of indirect function calls
# 2012-12-18 jspielvogel@keywcorp.com make use of the java heap size specified in py_common, use the new syntax when calling py_common.run_analysis()
# 2012-06-27 jspielvogel@keywcorp.com make use of py_common.create_or_clean_directory(), clean up code
# 2012-05-02 jspielvogel@keywcorp.com: added new run_analysis command to scan split directories, specify output path for .fprs, use py_common.print_with_timestamp
# 2011-12-01 pmkulin@nsa.gov: Fixed typo in -Xmx switch.
# 2011-11-30 pmkulin@nsa.gov: Increase Java heap size and enable Fortify's 64-bit mode, to avoid out-of-memory errors.
# 2011-11-23 pmkulin@nsa.gov: Added -clean step to delete intermediate files after each run, to keep from filling C: with temporary files
# 2011-11-17 pmkulin@nsa.gov: Added -verbose, -debug, -logfile, and -Xmx flags to match Java version of the script.  Increased memory to 1.6GB to (hopefully) avoid out-of-memory errors.
# 2010-08-04 john.laliberte@mandiant.com: run the fortify commands
# 2010-08-02 john.laliberte@mandiant.com: initial version
